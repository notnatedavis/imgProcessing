## Additional-Info

This portion is for logging or storing notes relevent to the project and its scope. I want to include down the line a file that shuffles an img's data (.txt) by some key. to start simple I want to attempt practical use of key , i.e. you can select a key (.txt) file to both apply and decode a shuffle , such that the key can be any length (0-somearbitrarynumber). any key of any size should function being applied to any encoded file of any size.
